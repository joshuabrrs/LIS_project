              What is VR/AR?
            </h2>
            <p class="post-subtitle">
              Virtual Reality (VR)is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment, allowing users to interact within a 3D world. It typically utilizes auditory and visual feedback through the use of a headset that covers the eyes fully.  VR sets may come equipped with handsets to further immerse the user in the simulated environment. The goal of VR is to immerse a user inside of an environment that closely mirrors the real world. Users are able to see, hear and touch within VR which allows them to fully interact with the environment that is created. VR can simulation, avatar-image, projector or desktop based. VR takes on its highest form of realism when it achieves a sense of presence for the user. This is when the user truly feels like they are a part of the environment being presented to them. When sense of presence is accomplished the users  change in perception is accurately maintained within the virtual environment, this in full creates a more natural experience for the user. 
             <br>
             <br> A sub form of Virtual Reality is Augmented Reality(AR) which consists of real-world objects being altered by computer-generated perception information. Typical uses have been for photos and video images. Where the two differ is in reference to how the users environment is altered. VR changes the entire environment into a new one, whereas AR alters the real world environment that the user is inside of.  With AR the user is able to digitally manipulate their environment using the integration of technology and  their real environment.  AR is compatible with most smartphones and tablets, making it easy to use in different settings. There are several other hardware devices that have been created for the use of AR such as the HUD, special eyeglasses and monitors specifically made to augment certain environments.

              History of VR
            </h2>
            <p class="post-subtitle">
              Us humans tend to fantasize about “other worlds”. Before technology, we used to tell stories through writing and art. The earliest attempts of Virtual Reality date back to the nineteenth century. Panoramic paintings were used to create an illusion that we are somewhere we are not. In 1838, Charles Wheatstone invented The Stereoscope. This used the idea that viewing two different images out of each eye creates a three-dimensional image. Next, Morton Heilig invented The Sensorama in 1962, which enhanced the idea of “reality” in Cinema through the incorporation of our other senses. He had a vision of a multi-sensory theatre, which would hopefully become “The Cinema of the Future”. While watching a series of five short films, the machine used odor emitters, a fan to simulate wind, and sounds to enhance the overall experience. Due to the complexity and high cost of the product, the work was halted. Although The Sensorama did not evolve to what he expected it to, this product brought a whole new perspective on Virtual Reality, influencing other scientists to want to create something of their own as well. The idea of using a VR headset, rather than an entire booth, was implemented first by Ivann Sutherland. <br><br> The concept of a Virtual Reality headset was commonly used in the 1960’s for military training. People were required to do extensive training through Virtual Reality headsets before entering the field so they are fully prepared. Over the next decade, scientists struggled with lack of portability and subpar graphics, putting a damper in the hopes for a fully real experience. In the 1990’s, these Virtual Reality devices became commercially available, yet was far too expensive for anyone to actually buy. In 1995, Nintendo created the Nintendo Virtual Boy that utilized a 3D gaming console. The game was heavily criticized due to its high price, low quality graphics, and lack of portability. After only selling 22 games in the United States, the product was discontinued. This event only encouraged other companies to attempt to make something even better. In the early 2000’s, technology began evolving rapidly. The past decade has brought forms of Virtual Reality that we never expected could exist. With the technology we have today, the future of Virtual Reality is limitless.

              Mixed reality in 50 years
            </h2>
            <p class="post-subtitle">
              Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are have use cases that didn’t seem to be possible when the Oculus Rift first began as a Kickstarter project in 2012. Some use cases are training for medical students to perform surgery on a virtual lab, NASA training astronauts for spacewalks, and educational games for classes to be immersed in history and science subjects. VR was introduced to the public as a gaming platform for people to be excited for but others saw the gaps it could fill. Recently, Microsoft secured a $480 million contract to provide HoloLens to the US Army for training. The Microsoft Hololens and Magic Leap are the two leaders in Augmented Reality headsets which allow users to see their reality transform.   The current path these technologies are heading seem to be exciting, VR games are becoming an experience in shopping malls and learning institutions are not shy to integrate VR into curriculums. Where I see mixed realities heading is an exciting yet freighting path. Mixed realities have become a gaming and learning platform, we might be seeing social aspects like apps and experiences in mixed reality within a few years. We could see our friends projected in our living rooms without any effort. Given that Facebook owns Oculus, we can’t be too excited about this almost certain feature.
              <br>
              <br>
              Aside from seeing promising features, mixed realities will also see a boost in hardware. Many users talk about motion sickness and eye strain with current setups. In the future, mixed reality headsets may display resolutions from 4K to 8K. VR is currently having multiple developers like Playstation, Oculus, HTC, Nintendo, Google...as the competition grows we can expect the price points to lower and mixed reality to become more accessible. Mixed reality headsets might even become something that can make TVs obsolete.   On top of all the features listed, VR/AR and headsets will become a lot more comfortable and allow users to use them for an extended time. We should be excited for what Mixed Realities can bring us and imagine the impossible.
